# Fall of Terra – Timeline of UST "de-peg" attack

## Summary

The following postmortum outlines the key events leading up to the "de-pegging" of UST and the subsequent crash of its native currency LUNA. It is meant to provide clarity on the state of the Terra Classic ecosystem as a whole and seperate fact from fiction while the Terra Rebels organization work to repair the damages caused by the stewardship of TFL & LFG, who have clearly decided to give up all hope of salvaging the mess they created and put their efforts into wiping the slate clean via rebooting the ecosystem on Terra v2.


## Timeline

| Time | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-11-25 | A twitter account by the name of Freddie Raynolds outlined a way to attack the existing model of the UST with a capital of $1B. [Reference link](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) | 
| 2022-04-13 | Luna Foundation Guard acquires more BTC. [Reference link](https://news.coincu.com/80549-luna-foundation-buys-2500-bitcoin-during-40k/) | 
| 2022-05-06 | Luna Foundation Guard acquires more BTC in OTC trading with Genesis Trading & 3AC. [Reference link](https://news.coincu.com/86477-luna-has-acquired-37863-bitcoins/) | 
| 2022-05-07 | Large amounts of UST withdrawn from Anchor Protocol. | 
| 2022-05-08 | UST was sold off on UST-3pool with about 285 million UST sold on Binance and Curve. 3pool almost recovered at the end of the day, which causes another discharge of UST into the markets. This time that resulted in the UST rate skyrocketing to around 65%. | 
| 2022-05-09 | Luna Foundation Guard used BTC in reserves to help defend the UST peg by loaning $750M worth of BTC to OTC trading firms, additionally another 750M $UST loan was granted to accumulate BTC as market conditions normalize. | 
| 2022-05-10 | LUNA 10 billion capitalizations have been wiped out. $9 billion of TVL was also withdrawn from the Terra ecosystem. UST has de-pegged from USDT and UST briefly droppes to $0.74. | 
| 2022-05-11 | LUNA Death Spiral begins. After throwing all the reserves into the market to pull the price of UST back to peg, Terra governance accepts sacrificing the price of LUNA to save its derivative UST product by changing the mechanism to burn UST and mint more LUNA. Specifically increasing BasePool size from 50M to 100M SDR and decreasing PoolRecoveryBlock from 36 to 18 Blocks. The idea was to increases mint/burn UST/LUNA capacity from $293M to $1200M in order to absorb UST being sold in the market. As a consequence the total amount of minted LUNA went to 1,190,951,936 and price began its decend from $30 towards $0.01. | 
| 2022-05-12 | After proposing 1164 to change the mint/burn LUNA/UST parameters, Terra governance launched proposal 1188, the idea was that by burning the remaining UST in the Community Pool and withdrawing all USTs in other ecosystems would reduce pressure on the peg. At the same time Terra would stake 240M LUNA to protect the network from an oracle attack. If this proposal was passed UST would be removed from the supply and thus relieve some of the selling pressure on UST. However, before the proposal was approved, the UST completely collapsed. | 
| 2022-05-12 | The validators on the Terra network decided to pause the blockchain at block number 7,603,700 to prevent "unspecified attacks" after the LUNA token was severely inflated.

| 2022-05-13 | Binance delisted LUNA & UST trading pairs. [Reference link](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/1b73e64616ee4e769c29e70c66728d1a?ref=AZTKZ9XS&utm_source=BinanceTwitter&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial) |
| 2022-05-13 | All efforts to save LUNA and UST were almost dissipated. Do Kwon proposed a new idea to “re-invent” the Terra network called the "Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan". |
| 2022-05-14 | The official circulating supply of LUNA hits 6.5 trillion tokens. Most likely caused by Luna Foundation Guard efforts to defend the UST peg with a "broken swap algo" |
| 2022-05-16 | Luna Foundation Guard reveales the status of their reserve fund on Twitter, as well as the fact that they had burnt billions of dollars trying to save UST from collapse. [Reference link](https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526126708193054721%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.coincu.com%2F90055-fall-of-terra%2F) |
| 2022-05-17 | Despite advice from CZ that a forked chain is worthless and against the will of the ecosystem at large Terra governance decides to create a new chain. The new chain will be Terra v2 without the algorithmic stablecoin. At this point TFL & LFG largely abandons their failed v1 experiment. |
| 2022-05-18 | Terra Rebels is founded in an effort to preseve the Terra Classic code after TFL & LFG has seemingly abandoned their responsibilities. |
| 2022-06-05 | Terra Rebels submit 3 different PRs to Terra Money in order to re-enable functionality that was disabled without a proper governance vote. |
| 2022-06-12 | Terra Rebels begin working on "burn tax" proposals. |
| 2022-06-19 | Terra Rebels have yet to hear anything from TFL & LFG. |

## Contributing Factors

- 20% interest on UST in Anchor with a fractional reserve banking system was never going to work. Most likely early investors knew this.
- Failure to provide sufficient collateralization to the UST market enabled the publically disclosed exploit to be used to crash UST & LUNA markets.
- Inexperienced management in TFL & LFG lead to bad decission making during the de-pegging event which cost billions of USD and minted trillions of LUNA.
- Proposing the "Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan" caused the existing ecosystem to fracture with all the "bag holders" left behind on Terra Classic and all the "smart money" moving to Terra v2.
- TFL & LFG refusal to engage with the Terra Rebels developer community caused people to leave the Terra ecosystem permanently and is preventing the Terra Classic governance system from working as intended.


## Lessons Learned

- Dont do fractional reserve banking with a 100% debt-2-asset ratio and unlimited supply cap.
- Dont let inexperienced managers handle billions of USD while greedy VCs are pushing them to launch unfinished products.
- Dont try to defend a synthetic derivative (UST) if your core asset (LUNA) is under threath.
- Dont take out million of USD for personal profit when your system is clearly illiquid by an order of magnitude.

## Action Items

- Re-enable Staking & Delegation in Terra Classic to allow proper governance to form over time. 
- Re-enable Swapping of LUNA => Terra & Terra => LUNA with new "supply constraints" to speed up the burn of LUNA tokens.
- Implement the burn proposals from the community
- Setup a independant CI/CD pipeline for terrad clients to enable validators to swap to software managed by Terra Rebels.
- Enable community validators to be setup and manged in order to strengthen the network as a whole
